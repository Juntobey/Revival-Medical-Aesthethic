# So far we are only going to test login in and registering

## so we have one folder authentication that handles login and registration and reset password and creating the model/table for users and user profile

and other functions for updating user profile will come here as well

# folder structure

## Authentication top directory

inside config that defines the credentials for logging in to the database

## Controller for handling requests coming from the frontend and directing them to the appropriate function

## Models this is where the table definition will be stored
